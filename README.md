Pig 2-Dice Game

Roll the dice to see who goes first.  Highest role of the die is the first player.

When a Pig player takes their turn, they can roll the dice as many times as they want.  Scoring is simple – whatever the number of dots show up on the dice, that’s your points for the roll.  You keep rolling and accumulating the points.  If you roll a 3, then a 5, then a 2, and then a 6 your points so far would be 3 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 16.

If one of the dice is a 1, no points are added to the overall score and your turn is over.  But, if BOTH the dice show up as 1’s your entire score goes back to zero (0), your turn is over, and you pass the dice to the other player.

In 2-Dice Pig, doubles score higher. Just add up the dice value and double it.  Rolling two 2’s = (2 + 2) x 2 = 8.  Rolling two 5’s = (5 + 5) x 2 = 20.  The same for 3’s, 4’s, and 6’s.

First player to 500 wins!
